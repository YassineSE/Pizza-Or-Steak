# Pizza-Or-Steak
* Binary Classifcation Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Description
The "Pizza Or Steak" DataSet is a subset of the `FOOD101` DataSet.
The objective of this mini-project is to classify this dataset using a Mini VGGNet like model architecture.
I also applied Data Augmentation to the model's training in order to reduce the overfitting. Surely this decision impacted the model's accuracy, but in return we can be certain that it will easily adapt to unseen data.
